This theme is built on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) - The Jekyll Butler.
Poole provides everything a developer needs to quick start a Jekyll project. It is built by the great @mdo himself.
I admire his work on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and love pretty much what he does. So here it is,
`Fission: An ultra-lite Jekyll theme.`


#### This is a code block

```
cd /opt/letsencrypt
sudo git pull
```

#### And this is how you embed your Gists
Simply wrap your gist id:

![gist](https://github.com/shankariyerr/fission/raw/master/public/gist.png)


{% gist c3ad9c67716a5f791f1974a606e15e07 %}

#### Jekyll-mentions
This theme includes [Jekyll-mentions](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-mentions) which helps tag people by simply adding `@` before a username.
Like @twitter

#### Jemoji
This comes with [Jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) support :sunglasses:

#### Sitemap
This awesome gem [jekyll-sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap) generates `sitemap.xml` automagically and stores it in `_site`  folder

#### Footnote
I plan to add more features and a proper `README`.

Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with [Atom](http://atom.io) while listening to this [Electro Swing Collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwWT43Eb3IM)
